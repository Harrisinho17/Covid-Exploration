# CExploration
Covid Exploration/ Data Exploration Project 

The provided SQL script is aimed at exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data through various SQL techniques, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and data type conversions. The queries handle tasks such as filtering, sorting, and calculating essential metrics related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different locations and time periods. The initial queries extract and display fundamental data from the 'CovidDeaths' table, while subsequent queries perform more complex analyses, such as determining the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in various countries and the percentage of the population infected.

Additionally, the script includes queries to identify countries with the highest infection and death rates relative to their populations and to compare death counts across continents. It leverages advanced SQL features like window functions to compute rolling sums of vaccinations, as well as CTEs and temporary tables for intermediate calculations. The creation of a view to store vaccination data aids in future visualizations. This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough exploration and understanding of the COVID-19 dataset, allowing for the extraction of meaningful insights for further analysis and reporting.
